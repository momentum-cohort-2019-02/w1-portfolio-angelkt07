        <p class="general">Simply put, I am a mother of three beautiful children who absolutely are the driving force behind all things in my life. The biggest take away that I have learned about myself over time is that they have made me a much better person then I had ever imagined for msyelf. Being a mother forces you to think much differently in my opinion. It instills in you the ability to face hardships and obstacles with a mix of grace and chaos that allows you to succeed and continue to grow as a person. I have found that because of this I have accepted a philosophy <i>"to not accept no or can't as an obstacle."</i> Meaning when things seem impossible, I search for another way. Even if that means instead of taking ten steps, I am only able to accomplish two. The key to this is to not give up and always focus on progress no matter how small or great, and continue to push forward.</p>

        <p class="general">Over the last 10-15 years I have been a part of many different aspects of a business. I started working at a very young age with simple jobs mainly focusing on customer service and general labor and steadily working my way up. Within a few years, I would be exposed to the retail industry with a heavy focus on customer service, and from there I moved to hospitality which is where I feel that I got the biggest push in mentality for my career path. In the hospitality industry you are exposed to sales, marketing, a higher level of customer service, property management, as well as basic reconciliation and account management. I quickly went from an entry level position to a supervisory position within the first six months. This then lead into traveling to other locations within the company that needed support as well as to help train new staff. From there I went in office administration ranging from data entry, data analysis, account reconciliation, contractor payroll, department management, and support to the software development team on product implementation. This role would lead to my newest adventure and goal of learning how to develop software and become a Software Engineer.</p>

        <p class="general">My goal is to continue to grow as a person and in my career. Eventually I would like to use all of the skills that I have acquired to open my own small business and create a legacy for my children. </p>
