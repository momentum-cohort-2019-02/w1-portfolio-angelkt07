            <p class="about-photo">I got into photography because of my art. I was a very active artist from middle school all the way through high school. Unfortunately when I had my kids, I had to stop all of my art projects.  There was never enough time to do anything except be a mom. With that said, the list of what I wanted to do never stopped growing. I would see a sunset that I wanted to paint, or I would see a street scape that would be amazing as a sketch, or even a portrait that I thought would look fantastic as a sketch or painting. I was extremely upset over a stagnant portfolio that never seemed to get looked at, let alone updated. Then I had an idea! Since I never had to time to slow down and work on my art the way I used to before the kids, I figured why not take a photo to come back to later!!? At the time I thought it was a save-all for my number one hobby/interest at the time, but little did I know it would lead me to one I might love even more.</p>
            <p class="about-photo-1">Please view some of my shots below and please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in any or would like to talk about a project that I might can help with.</p>
