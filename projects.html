                                they
                                have available. The goal was to provide a simple yet effective website that showed the

                            <p class="dog">Happy Valley Shelter has a special place is several peoples hearts, but their website
                                was severely outdated. The director felt that several dogs were not being adopted
                                simply because people couldn't see their qualities in a useful way. The idea is if they
                                can see what the dog is like before driving out, they would be more likely to pick the
                                right pet the first time. Better customer experience and higher adoption rates is the
                                end goal for this site. Click the picture to the right to view the dogs available at Happy Valley
