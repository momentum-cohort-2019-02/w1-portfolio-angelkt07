                            <p>Happy Valley Shelter has a special place is several peoples hearts, but their website was severely outdated. The director felt that several dogs were not being adopted simply because people couldn't see their qualities in a useful way. The idea is if they can see what the dog is like before driving out, they would be more likely to pick the right pet the first time. Better customer experience and higher adoption rates is the end goal for this site. Click the picture to view the dogs available at Happy Valley Shelter.</p>
